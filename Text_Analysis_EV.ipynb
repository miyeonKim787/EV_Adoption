        "The automotive landscape is undergoing a revolutionary transformation as society pivots towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions. In August 2022, Congress approved a sweeping reform of the electrical vehicles (\"EV\") tax credits as part of the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n",
        "\n",
        "Consumers currently can take advantage of the 7,500 new EV credit or the $4,000 used EV credit when they file their tax returns the following year. More enticingly, starting in January 2024, consumers can transfer the credits to a car dealer, effectively lowering the vehicle’s purchase price.\n",
        "\n",
        "But despite the benefits EVs offer - from government incenvites to contributing to a cleaner form of mobility - the widespread adoption of EVs has been met with various challenges, leading to a slower-than-expected transition from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE). For example, as reported by The Economist, \"a poll published in July by the Pew Research Centre found that less than two-fifths of them would consider buying an electric vehicle.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This project attempts to understand the roadblocks to EV adoption, told from the perspective of potential customers, by collecting data via Youtube API and conducting TF-IDF and topic modelling analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "My research seeks to answer the question, **\"What are the roadblocks to EV adoption?\"** I hope to understand the factors that cause customers to be hesitant of or skeptical of switching their cars from ICE vehicles to EVs, particularly after the U.S. government's announcements to offer incentives for Americans (e.g., in the form of tax credit when they purchase EVs). This research topic has important policy implications because it can distill the pain points people face in choosing to adopt EVs, and therefore, offer insights to the policymakers on how to address customers' concerns. These findings can help the government to accelerate the transition of electrifying mobility for a cleaner future."

        "\n",
        "For this research, I found it critical to analyze unfiltered, honest and diverse opinions on the challenges of switching into EV cars. As such, the approach I took was to aggregate comments via YouTube's API for my data collection. I selected a video, which was on one of the most-viewed videos on EVs pertaining to my research topic, published by a reputable news organization - CNBC. I chose this video because (1) it was published around 1 year after the Congress approved the IRA, and I was interested to capture sentiment over a sufficient time frame since Congress passed the IRA; (2) the video had over 3.8M views, suggesting the high-quality content of the video; (3) it had over 21,000 comments, which suggested that the audience was engaged or had experiences/informed opinions on the issue and that the video would contain a variety of opinions; and (4) because it published by CNBC, this would attract an audience that tended to be aware of the latest topics and would contain comments that were useful to the analysis, as opposed to for example, comments filled with spam or online trolling.    \n",

        "\n",
        "***Text Analysis***\n",
        "\n",
        "In line with my research objective of elucidating the common challenges to adopting EVs, post the IRA introducing sweeping policies that would benefit customers, I conducted text analysis through (1) topic modelling - this was to be able to get a holistic idea of consumers' key concerns; (2) TF-IDF - this was to be able to get an even more granular view of the topics that were critical to consumers by cancelling out any noise from stopwords; (3) visualizing text data by wordcloud; and (4) conducting sentiment analysis to understand how consumers felt about adopting EVs since the governments' incentives were introduced."

            "2023-12-17T20:14:24Z       @peterazlac1739 Elon Musk hit the nail on the head when he said the real bottleneck for EV sales was power supplies and the rate of build out of the grid system to supply he power quite apart from the fantasy that it can be provided by wind and solar. That is why in 2024, like Toyota and others, Tesla will launch a car using hydrogen. Some manufacturers like Porsche will use it in a conventional engine, like JCB already does in the diesel engines used in its constructions and farm equipment, others will go for hydrogen fuel cells or water engines that only need a limited capacity backup battery and so are lighter giving them more range So by 2035 we may well see battery EVs limited to home owners with substantial roof solar and battery packs who only need a range for local driving outside the odd long leisure trip and the rest will drive conventional cars or hybrids using synthetic fuel or hydrogen or hydrogen fuel cell ones. I would also guess the reason people are buying Tesla cars over competitors is the availability of fast charging stations. A reason people are not buying EVs, at least in Europe, are battery fires and the high insurance costs due to them and the costs of repairing an EV over a conventional car plus thanks to the battery fire at Luton Airport that destroyed a £20 million multistory car park similar car parks are banning EVs due to the fire risk but also the effect of the heavier weight on the structural loading.\n",

They&#39;re told that EV owners have to wait for hours for their cars to charge (lie except on a home charger where it doesn&#39;t matter). They&#39;re told that EV&#39;s are only good for driving short distances (lie). The lies being propagated are seemingly endless.\n",

With prices have gone up. Salarys dont go up. No more manufacturing jobs. People cant afford it. If the battery needs to be changed   the amount to change it is anout 20,000.00 to 30,000.00 thats a downpayment to a house. Plus the EV&#39;S BASE  cost is high. Plus it depends on where you live. If you have a house you can you can charge at home. If you live in an apartment you cant really charge. Or live in city you cant charge. There is not much charging stations. Plus the range of the EV is not that far then charge frequently. Now there is no access lane especially in california. There were made into expresslanes. Where using it charges you money just to use it.\n",

Ford F-150, Chevy 1500, and Ram 1500.  What do the all have in common?  They are trucks!  Now, how many cars does:  Ford, Chevy, and Dodge sell?   Not many, because there is a small market for them.   <br><br>Most EV’s are cars.  Knowing that trucks are the best sellers and Cars don’t sell well, what can we assume about EV car sales? (Hint: car sales are only a small fraction of auto sales)<br><br>People that need/want a truck or a 6 passenger vehicles aren’t going to buy a car whether it’s gas or electric.  So until a plethora of EV trucks and SUV’s hit the market sales are going to stagnate.\n",
