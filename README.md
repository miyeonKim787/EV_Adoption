# Roadblocks to EV Adoption

The automotive landscape finds itself at a crossroads, in the wake of a shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions. Notably, the electric vehicle (EV) sector has experienced a significant boost with Congress's recent approval of the comprehensive electrical vehicle tax credit reform as part of the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022. 

Moreover, California recently made a commitment mandating that by 2035, 100% of new cars and light trucks sold in the state will be zero-emission vehicles. There is therefore a clear political will and discourse on sustainable transportation solutions.

As of now, consumers have the opportunity to leverage a USD 7500 tax credit for new EV purchases or a USD 4000 credit for used EVs when filing their tax returns the following year. These incentives are even more compelling as commencing January 2024, consumers can transfer these credits directly to car dealers, effectively reducing the purchase price of the vehicle. Despite such substantial financial incentives and the promising prospect of contributing to a cleaner mode of mobility, the mass adoption of EVs faces hurdles, resulting in a slower-than-expected transition from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE).

For instance, recent data, as reported by The Economist, highlights a significant hesitation among potential consumers. A poll published in July by the Pew Research Centre revealed that less than two-fifths of respondents would consider purchasing an electric vehicle. This reluctance raises pertinent questions about the barriers preventing the seamless integration of EVs into everyday life.

The aim of this project is to analyse impediments to widespread EV adoption, focusing on the perspective of potential customers. The project leverages YouTube API's to aggregate relevant customer sentiment and employs TF-IDF, topic modelling analysis, sentiment analysis, as well as a visualisation via Word Cloud.
