# Roadblocks to EV Adoption
The automotive landscape is undergoing a revolutionary transformation as society pivots towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions. In August 2022, Congress approved a sweeping reform of the electrical vehicles ("EV") tax credits as part of the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 

Consumers currently can take advantage of the $7,500 new EV credit or $4,000 used EV credit when they file their tax returns the following year, but starting in January 2024, consumers can transfer the credits to a car dealer, effectively lowering the vehicle’s purchase price. 

But despite the benefits EVs offer - from government incenvites to contributing to a cleaner form of mobility - the widespread adoption of EVs has been met with various challenges, leading to a slower-than-expected transition from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE). For example, as reported by The Economist, "a poll published in July by the Pew Research Centre found that less than two-fifths of them would consider buying an electric vehicle."

This project attempts to understand the roadblocks to EV adoption by collecting data via Youtube API and conducting TF-IDF and topic modelling analysis.
